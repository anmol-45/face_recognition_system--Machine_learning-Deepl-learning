👤 Face Encoding Generator for Student Identification
This Python project is designed to generate facial encodings for student images using the face_recognition library and save them to a serialized .p (pickle) file for later use—likely in an attendance system or facial recognition-based authentication tool.

🧰 Features
Loads images from a specified images/ directory.

Automatically extracts student IDs from image filenames.

Encodes all faces using the face_recognition library.

Serializes the encoded data with corresponding IDs using pickle.

📁 Project Structure

.
├── images/                 # Directory where student images are stored
├── encodeFile.p           # Output pickle file with encodings and IDs
└── encode_generator.py    # Main script (your uploaded file)
🚀 Getting Started
1. Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install face_recognition opencv-python
Note: face_recognition requires dlib which may need CMake and Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows.

2. Add Student Images
Place student face images in the images/ folder.

Name each image file with the student ID (e.g., 12345.jpg, john_doe.png).

3. Run the script
bash
Copy
Edit
python encode_generator.py
This will generate a file named encodeFile.p that contains the face encodings and corresponding student IDs.

🧠 How It Works
The script loads each image from the images/ folder.

It encodes each face using face_recognition.face_encodings().

All encodings along with extracted student IDs are stored as a list of two elements and serialized using pickle.

📦 Output
encodeFile.p – Contains:

encodedList – List of 128-dimensional face encodings.

studentIds – List of IDs matching the filenames.

🔒 Use Cases
Automated classroom attendance systems.

Student verification in secure portals.

Face-based login or access control systems.
